*Bugs in the program*

1)
Problem:
I was incrementing address by 1 to get to the next pixel when calculating the pixel in the buffer for vertical line function 
Solution:
You need to add scroll_size as it was the pixel in the next row

2)
Problem:
VGA Register value set to 16C instead of 16B. this error was because 182*2=364 which
is 16C in hex was set and I was losing part of my status bar.
Solution:
We needed the horizontal divide just above 16B as line divide is between to rows and not a row by itself

3)
Problem:
Passing in a const char* as argument gave warning.
Solution:
Pass Argument after typecasting it

4)
Problem:
I was creating a local instance of my status bar buffer in my text.c so my original buffer
was not getting updated
Solution:
Use extern on my status bar buffer decleration in text.c and include modex.c in text.c

5)
Problem:
Octree level 4 gave a blackish picture even though after checking first few values of palette, they were correct

Solution:
Initialise level4 buffer to 0s as it will give error otherwise even if GDB says its all 0s in one instance of the program running

6)
Problem:
Octree level 2 didn't give desired output causing minor issues in the image

Solution:
while filling in level 2 make sure to add to current running sum instead of normal assignment unless its the first pixel in the node

7)
Problem:
Tux controller gave opposing values for left and down buttons

Solution:
Values received from tux and sent to user have different orders that need to be accounted for

8)
Problem:
Keyboard and tux doesn't work in the same run

Solution:
Both flags in input.c need to be set to 0. The flag USE_TUX is basically just USE_ONLY_TUX

9)
Problem:
Buttons made screen move uncontrollably when program was run

Solution:
Buttons are active low and should be initialised to all 1s instead of all 0s

10)
Problem:
Insert,Home,Pgup buttons shouldn't change screens if long pressed

Solution:
Mantain a flag that doesn't allow the same button to continue to function.
