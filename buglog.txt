Bugs in the program
1)
I was incrementing address by 1 to get to the next pixel but needed to add 
scroll_size as it was the pixel in the next row
2)
VGA Register value set to 16C instead of 16B. this error was because 182*2=364 which
is 16C in hex but we needed the horizontal divide just above that so 16C was making
me lose part of my status bar.
3)
Passing in a const char* (without type casting it) as argument gave warning.
4)
I was not using extern on my status bar buffer and I was creating
a local instance of it in my text.c so my original buffer
was not getting updated
5)My pixel panning mode set to 1 was still allowing scrolling but I forgot to 
set the register after initialization instead of during which caused the problem.
